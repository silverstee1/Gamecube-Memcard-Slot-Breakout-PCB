Gamecube Memory Card Slot Breakout PCB Gerbers

PCB breakout Gerbers for the front 2 memory card slots.
When ordering Select 1.6mm pcb thickness with ENIG surface finish, I've ordered HASL cause its cheaper for 1 off tests.

EXTIN and EXTOUT are connected on the PCB via a jumper trace telling the gamecube a device is inserted in the slot.

TODO: 
- 3D Printed STL Case for the PCB.
- Waiting on PCB's for test fit and accuracy.
